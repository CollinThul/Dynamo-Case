# Gridwise


Gridwise is a mobile platform for rideshare drivers that improves their earnings and experience around driving. The platform focuses on a few key features: 
* __Airport Demand Forecasts.__ Spend less time waiting for trips to and from the airport by knowing exactly how many passengers are arriving and departing. 
* __Overview of City Wide Events.__ Increase your daily number of trips by staying aware of potentially high rider-demand events and activities happening in your city. 
* __Real time Alerts__. Stay abreast of happenings near you, with real-time alerts on event updates, weather information in your city, and peak periods of airport traffic volumes.  
* __Driver Taskbar.__ From one central location, easily navigate between apps you use most oftern while driving; including your rideshare, navigation, and also the Gridwise app. 

  
__*Quality of Founding Team*__

Ryan Green attended the United States Naval Academy where he studied economics as well as playing division 1 football. He developed real world financial practicality in his time with the Navy as a Finance officer.  Ryan also has experience as an entrepreneur as the Co-Founder of FXConnection, a platform that allowed novice investors to learn and execute foreign exchange trades, while at the Naval Academey. The spirit of FXConnection is apparent in Gridwise, as they both exist to empower entrepreneurs to succeed. Ryan has been a leader in many different positions, and  gives me confidence that he can lead a successful company. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanagreen/

Brian Finamore complements Ryan with a very different skill set. He has an exceptionally strong technical background, with a B.S in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Cornell, and a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon. With 10+ years of experience in the field with top companies such as Boeing and US Airways, Brain appears to be imminently qualified as the CTO of Gridwise. https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-finamore/

These two represent the classic entrepreneurial team, with leadership and financial expertise in one, and an exceptional mind for technology in the other. 

 
  __*Size and Penetrability of the Market Opportunity*__
   
   The primary market for Gridwise is ride-sharing drivers in the United States. The number of exact drivers in this market is difficult to nail down due to churn and the part time nature of the job. However, the Brookings institute estimates that as of the end of 2015 there were ~563,400 drivers operating in the United States with 92% of them operating in the 100 largest cities. Currently Gridwise is offered in Pittsburg and D.C.  This represents a 63% increase year over year, and shows an acceleration of an already impressive growth trend in the US. There are also estimated to be well over a million active drivers worldwide. Although there has been growth in the driver market, both Lyft and Uber are actively trying to eliminate the need for drivers through the implementation of autonomous cars. Lyft has paired with Waymo and General Motors, while Uber is working with Daimler and Carnegie Mellon.

Gridwise offers its platform in the form of a phone application. As having an internet enabled phone is nearly a prerequisite for driving for a ride sharing company, there is no impediment for integration via hardware. The application is already offered through the app store, both in the Apple and Android networks. 

Competition in this market is quite fragmented as drivers traditionally want to use the best apps possible to do each function, ie. Weather.com for weather, pandora for music, google maps for GPS, Uber/Lyft for pickup, twitter for information etc.  Gridwise allows for access to all of these quickly through their dashboard. ![](https://github.com/CollinThul/Dynamo-Case/blob/master/gridwise1.JPG?raw=true)

Key competitors to Gridwise are Mystro, Lyft for drivers, and Uber for drivers. Mystro exists primarily to allow drivers to work for Lyft and Uber simultaneously. Although it is a slightly different product, it is attempting to solve the same problem as Gridwise in the sense that it is trying to maximize driver's earnings. However, Mystro currently is not offered for iPhones and does not offer the key information of where possible riders are congregating. 

  
   __*The Problem and The Solution*__
   
  The problem that Gridwise exists to solve is that people are not earning enough money in their part time job as ride share drivers. The existence of part time occupations such as Uber driver have come out of the gig economy and its propensity for part time work. Whether this is good or bad is another issue, but the fact of the matter is that drivers that do this as a part time job need to earn more. As these drivers are not full time professionals, they may not know exactly how to maximize their time driving. This is how Gridwise earns drivers more per hour, by showing them when and where they should be driving to maximize pickups and profits. According to Gridwise, their drivers earn 30-60% more per week after starting to use the application. 
  
  
   __*Investment Recommendation*__
   
   I would not recommend that Dyanamo invest in Gridwise. I find the founding team impressive in background, with complementary skills. However, I believe that there are fundamental issues with the product and market.
   
1. The product that Gridwise offers does not appear to be easily defended. I cannot speak to the software at this point, but the primary value proposition that is offered by Gridwise can, and has been replicated. This is especially true because Uber and Lyft offer competitive services within their application (ie population hotspots, flight and event info, etc.) which drivers must use. The product offered by Gridwise may be better than what Uber and Lyft offer, but not so much better that people are willing to use a whole other application for a marginal improvement. Over the last two weeks I have taken a number of Uber rides (for fun, and for research). I asked every driver if they have used, or heard of Gridwise. None had, and that was not surprising due to their size. When I explained to the drivers what the application did, I was surprised how tepid the response was. Nearly every driver I spoke to said that they would not want to use a new application if there was something similar to it in the Uber or Lyft app. Many expressed the desire to change applications while driving as little as possible. I thought that was indicative of the fundamental challenge faced by this application.

2. The second problem issue builds on the first. The market for Gridwise is inherently reliant on that of the number of people who use Uber and Lyft. Although this is a growing number of people worldwide, the success of Gridwise is intertwined with the success of the other two. No one besides rideshare drivers have an incentive to use this application, and because of that fact, there is a defined ceiling for growth. 

3. When looking at applications, especially those who do not charge for their services, it is important to look at the customer acquisition cost and lifetime value. I have reached out to the founders of this company but have not heard back as of this time. I believe that they will face significant challenges in this area because of the churn rate of Uber and Lyft drivers. Even if Gridwise can find an effective low cost way to acquire new customers, it will have a challenge to retain them long enough for them to payoff. According to Ubers own statistics from an internal study, 11% of new drivers stop driving within a month and roughly half quit within a year. If these drivers will no longer need the services of Gridwise after they stop driving, it means that Gridwise will need to continually attract new customers to even maintain a steady customer base. However, the argument can be made that an application that makes rideshare driving much better (ie. Gridwise) could lengthen the period that drivers remain active and thus mitigate this issue through its own existence. The company makes no such claim at this point, but it would be something that I would be worth researching.

__Questions I would like to find out that I have not been able to thus far.__ 

What is their estimated CAC?

I would imagine revenue will be generated through ad sales. Will there be an issue of drivers looking at ads while driving, and possible deter advertisers?

Does the app keep people driving Uber/Lyft for a longer period of time?

Is the increase in driver revenue due to a higher revenue per hour, or does it lead drivers work longer and that is where the increase in revenue is?

Data on the Beta tests in Washington D.C and if they are getting similar results as they did in Pittsburg? IE. Is it easily migrated from city to city?
