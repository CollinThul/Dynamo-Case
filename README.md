__Gridwise is being reviewed for a seed stage funding venuture by Dynamo.__

Gridwise is a mobile platform for on-demand drivers that improves their earnings and experience around driving. The platform focuses on a few key features: 
* Airport Demand forecasts. This allows drivers to know when flights are landing/leaving and how many passengers are on given flights. 
* Overview of City wide events. Allows awareness of potentially high rider-demand events and activities. 
* Real time Alerts. Provides geographically focused updates on weather, changes in events, and other notable updates that rideshare drivers might be interested in. 
* Driver Taskbar. This central page allows integration of other apps that drivers need into the Gridwise platform. (Show image of dashboard) It shows all the services of Gridwise (airport info, weather, events, etc.) while allowing drivers to quickly access apps like Uber, Lyft, Maps, etc. 

  
   *Quality of Founding Team*
   
Two incredibly impressive individuals that founded Gridwise, with extremely different backgrounds:

Ryan Green is a military man with a financial background. He attended the United States Naval Academy where he studied economics as well as played division 1 football. He developed real world financial practicality in his time with the Navy as a Finance officer.  Ryan also has experience as an entrepreneur as the Co-Founder of FXConnection, a platform that allowed novice investors to learn and execute foreign exchange trades. The spirit of FXConnection is apparent in Gridwise, as they both exist to empower entrepreneurs to succeed. Ryan has been a leader at every position that he has been in and seems to thrive in those positions. He also has a deep knowledge of finance that he has used to not only lead a Navy company, but to start two companies. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanagreen/

Brian Finamore is all of the things that Ryan Green is not. He has an exceptionally strong technical background, with a B.S in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Cornell, and a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon. With 10+ years of experience in the field with top companies such as Boeing and US Airways, Brain appears to be imminently qualified as the CTO of Gridwise. https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-finamore/

These two represent the classic entrepreneurial team, with leadership and financial expertise in one, and an exceptional mind for technology in the other. They are backed by an impressive technical team of Anthony Corletti as lead engineer, and Olisa Okonkwo as lead UI/UX designer.  (.

   *Size and Penetrability of the Market Opportunity*
   
   The primary market for Gridwise is ride-sharing drivers in the United States. The number of exact drivers in this market is difficult to nail down due to churn and the part time nature of the job. However, the Brookings institute estimates that as of the end of 2015 there were ~563,400 drivers operating in the United States with 92% of them operating in the 100 largest cities.  This represents a 63% increase year over year, and shows an acceleration of an already impressive growth trend.
   
Gridwise offers its platform in the form of a phone application. As having an internet enabled phone is nearly a prerequisite for driving for a ride sharing company, there is no impediment for integration via hardware. The application is already offered through the app store, both in the Apple and Android networks.

__Find out go to market strategy, and info on CAC__
__Currently the application is free on the app store. Revenue must be generated through advertisements?__
__Is it sticky? How long do people stay on the app (hours/day and months)__ 

Competition in this market is quite fragmented as drivers traditionally want to use the best apps possible to do each function, ie. Weather.com for weather, pandora for music, google maps for GPS, Uber/Lyft for pickup, twitter for information etc.  Gridwise allows for access to all of these, while operating on their platform which provides drivers unique capabilities such as their flight and event information. 

Key competitor to Gridwise is Mystro. Mystro exists primarily to allow drivers to work for Lyft and Uber simultaneously. Although it is a slightly different product, it is doing the same thing as Gridwise in the sense that it is trying to maximize drivers time and earnings. However, Mystro currently is not offered for iPhones and does not offer the key information of where possible riders are congregating. 

  
   *The Problem and The Solution*
   
  The problem that Gridwise exists to solve is that people are not earning enough money in their part time job as ride share drivers. The existence of part time occupations such as Uber driver have come out of the gig economy and its propensity for part time work. Whether this is good or bad is another issue, but the fact of the matter is that drivers that do this as a part time job want to earn more. As these drivers are not full time professionals, they may not know exactly how to maximize their time driving. This is how Gridwise earns drivers more per hour, by showing them when and where they should be driving to maximize pickups and profits. 
  
  __More about how they actually know when and where people are going to be places__ 
  
  According to Gridwise, their drivers earn 30-60% more per week after starting to use the app. (Need to verify that this is not just because people are driving moreâ€¦.. find out earnings/mile or earnings/hour).

   *Investment Size*
  
  1. Investment Size
  
  $500,000
  
  2. What to be used for
  
  . Dynamo and its partners would be helpful in fleshing out and implementing their go to market strategy with drivers. There clearly is a solid product market fit, but the implementation of such is not as apparent.  The Dynamo investment will also be used to expand the city offering (not offered in Chattanooga).
